# Project Objective

A major part of this course is a group project, in which you will work in teams to build an interactive visualization on a topic of your own choosing. You will acquire the data, design your visualization, implement it using Tableau, and evaluate the results.

Generally, your final project visualization must fulfill at least two of these main requirements

- Implement a visualization with multiple coordinated (linked) views
- Implement a visualization with intuitive and useful interactions
- Implement at least one innovative view that either extends an existing visualization type we discussed in class or presents a novel visualization type of your own design.

You will complete this project in your existing project groups from the Viz of the Week project.

***This project is the chance for you and your group to show off your skills and develop something that will impress me and the rest of the class.\***

*The final project is worth 25% of your final grade.*

# Data

You are responsible for finding data for your project. The data you select should have a business-related theme; however, this can be loosely interpreted. For example, soccer player salaries or Airbnb rental trends are both acceptable topics.

There are many publicly available data sets and sources to choose from. Many data resources have already been posted for you on this page in Canvas: [**Useful Places to Find Data**](https://canvas.emory.edu/courses/103827/pages/useful-places-to-find-data)

***You must cite, in your viz, the sources for any data used.***

Additionally, the Business Library has put together a nice list of databases and data resources available through Emory and Goizueta, which can be found here:

https://guides.business.library.emory.edu/data_visualization

***COVID-19 NOTE: Given the overwhelming abundance of COVID-19 data visualization out there you must produce an original visualization that provides new and interesting insights if your final project relates to COVID-19.***

# Deliverables and Due Dates

Your project requires the completion of several deliverables, listed below.  ***No late projects will be accepted.*** The Final Visualization files and Detailed Slides should be uploaded to Canvas using the [***Final Project Files Assignment.***](https://canvas.emory.edu/courses/103827/assignments/659688) The percentages below refer to the percentage each deliverable contributes toward your final project grade.

#### Final Visualization (70% of final project grade) Due December 6th at 11:59 PM

1. You must post your visualization to Tableau Public online so that the instructor and other students can view and interact with it.

2. You must post a link to your hosted visualization on the Canvas discussion page

    

   ***Final Projects - Tableau Public Links***

   .

    

   Add your project title, your group number and members, and a link to the Tableau Public hosted visualization.

   - You can upload your dashboard by selecting from the top menu in ***Tableau Server ->\******Tableau Public ->\*** ***Save to Tableau Public As.\*** You will be prompted to log in to your Tableau Public Account (this is not the same as your Tableau Community account). If you don't have one create one. Once you've logged in there will be options to customize how your dashboard is published. Tableau may ask you to create a data extraction for your dashboard before you can publish to the Tableau Public Server - follow the instructions to do so. For more information see [http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/publish_workbooks_tableaupublic.html Links to an external site.](http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/publish_workbooks_tableaupublic.html). (NOTE: That this uses a prior version of Tableau and the "Save to Tableau Public As" is in a different menu location now, as outlined above).

3. You must submit your Tableau packaged workbook(s) through the Canvas [***Final Project Files Assignment\***.](https://canvas.emory.edu/courses/103827/assignments/659688) You will use this assignment to attach your workbooks, detailed slides (see below), and any other materials you wish to include.

#### Detailed Slides (10% of final project grade) Due December 6th at 11:59 PM

In lieu of a formal written report, please create a slide deck that provides details for how you created your final visualization. Think of this as an extended version of your presentation (discussed below). You must cite all of your sources, including data, code, and inspiration. You will submit the detailed slide deck using the [***Final Project Files Assignment\***](https://canvas.emory.edu/courses/103827/assignments/659688)[ ](https://canvas.emory.edu/courses/103827/pages/$CANVAS_OBJECT_REFERENCE$/assignments/g64ed5605121f4de8e27eabf392571fe1)in Canvas. The deck should contain the following topics/sections:

- Overview and Motivation: Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation for it.
- Related Work and Inspiration: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a website, visualizations we discussed in class, etc.
- Questions: What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?
- Data: Source, the method for acquiring data, data cleanup or augmentation, etc.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: What visualizations did you use to initially look at your data? What insights did you gain? How did these insights inform your design? How did you transform your data?
- Design Evolution: What are the different visualizations you considered? Justify the design decisions you made using the perceptual and design principles you learned in the course. Did you deviate from your original plan?
- Implementation: Describe the intent and functionality of the interactive visualizations you implemented. Provide clear and well-referenced images showing the key design and interaction elements.
- Insights and Self Evaluation: What did you learn about the data by using your visualizations? How did you answer your questions? How well does your visualization work, and how could you further improve it?

The slides should present the above information succinctly and clearly.

#### Visualization Presentation (20% of final project grade) ***Due on the Day Your Team Presents***.

You will have 10 minutes to present your visualization to the class. Your team will be randomly assigned to one of the presentation days and slots on the schedule. ***F*****i\*nal presentations will be live in class on 11/29, 12/1, and 12/6***.

***Your live presentation should focus on a demo of the visualization. You do not need to cover all of the information in your detailed slides in your live presentation. Have a condensed deck for the presentation and demo.***

# Project Evaluation

# Final projects will be evaluated on the following criteria:

- Overall Effectiveness of the visualizations created
- Innovative use of visualization techniques, linking, and other features
- Level of technical difficulty and technical execution
- Clear storytelling and communication of your visualization goals and quantitative messages in the visualization itself and in your presentation
- The visual design aesthetic of the visualization
- Effectiveness and sensibility of the interactions used in the visualization
- Clarity and effectiveness of the presentation and demo and detailed slides

#### Group Peer Assessment (your own group) Due Friday, December 9th, 11:59 PM

You will evaluate the other members of your own group using the peer evaluation form: [https://forms.gle/q1A](https://forms.gle/q1Aad6Rh9HFRhS7n8)
