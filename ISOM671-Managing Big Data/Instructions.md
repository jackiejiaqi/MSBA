# Code and Report

**Please remember to submit the following components:**

**1. Project report (see details below) - 5%**

**2. Project data wrangling, code (please make sure you document the code) - 10%** 



**Project data and code - no size limit**

- Please make sure the code is working and we can open the data files so we can test it on our end.
- If executing code correctly requires some tasks (loading data into mySQL, fixing data file path, etc), please do specify those as comments at the top of the code file.
- 40% of the code grade will be assigned for data organization, processing, and storage, 40% of the grade will be assigned for data analysis/insights queries, 10% will be assigned for documentation in code files, and 10% will be assigned to visual outputs of the code - i.e. tables, charts, summary reports, etc. 

 

**Report – write-up (max 4-pages double-spaced, up to 4 additional pages for exhibits)**

- Discuss the business problem (approx: 0.5 page)
- Discuss the data ingestion, processing, transformation, and challenges (approx: 1 page)
- Discuss the insights for a selected organization (approx: 1.5 pages)
- 70% of the write-up grade will be assigned to insights extracted from data and your reasoning on how it will help the organization. remaining will be distributed to writing (15%), and structure (15%) 

 

**Project expectations (of tasks):**

- Topic, organization, and data selection (proposal)
  - Structures and/or unstructured data (1GB+) – consider multiple sources
    - Possible data sources: data.gov, registry.opendata.aws, Kaggle.com
  - Identify interesting analytics question you want to explore (can change later)
- Database Design (RDBMS and/or NoSQL)
  - Data models
  - ER Model
    - Keys and attributes
- Insight development
  - Grouped summary statistics
  - Visualizations (try to connect to Tableau, R, or Python)
- Analysis
  - SQL, Python (Spark), or R (AWS RStudio) based analytics to answer the identified question(s)
  - Discussion of potential value of analytics for selected organization

 

**Possible write-up structure (you don’t need to follow it exactly - but it provide components that are typically seen in project reports created for executives at an organization):**

1. Executive Summary (1-paragraph)
2. Introduction (0.5-page)
   1. Motivation for the project: why select that specific organization, why select the specific project, etc.
   2. Discuss importance and value of results (possible hypotheses)
3. Data wrangling (1-page) 
   1. Summary statistics of data
   2. Dataset wrangling process
   3. Challenges and limitations of the data
4. Insights & analytics (1 to 1.5 pages)
   1. Model free insights from data
   2. Model driven insights (results) form data
   3. Reasons for selection of a specific approach
5. Discussion (0.5 to 1 page)
   1. Application and value for the organization
   2. Generalizability of the insights
   3. Critical analysis of findings
   4. SWOT analysis

# Presentation

**Class Presentation: 5%**

Create a unlisted YouTube presentation video (max 10mins) and submit the link for grading. The whole class will receive the video links and will get a chance to contribute to the grading.

- Submit YouTube video link as comment on the assignment submission - all video links will be shared with everyone in the class.
- Submit presentation slides

 

**Grading:**

- 20% of the presentation grade will be based on your peer and TA evaluations of your presentation - they will evaluate based on 3-Cs: content, communication, and clarity.
  - Team with any members that do not provide feedback on other presentations will not receive feedback score from peers (everyone will get scores from TAs). 
- 80% of presentation grade will be assigned by the instructor based on followig metrics:
  - 40% for content and critical thought process 
  - 25% for clarity on your data analytics process - (ingestion, processing, analysis, and reporting) 
  - 15% for communicating effectively to tell a compelling story

 

**Notes:**

- If I have any questions, I will post those on canvas as comment to your submission.
- Do not exceed allocated time (10mins) – I can’t assign a full grade for those presentations
- Make sure all team members are presenting – if someone does not present they can’t get presentation grade
- Submit only .PPT or .PDF version of the slides (no Google slides or late submissions)
- Plan to create 10 slides only (this is not a strict limit, but the observed average time/slide is about 1min)
- You can use audio/video features or demo to enrich your presentation video but they will play no role in my grading. 
  - You may want to do this to if you decide to share the video later with recruiters
